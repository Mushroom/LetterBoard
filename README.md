# 3D Printable Letter Board
This is completely designed from scratch in OpenSCAD - this was my first attempt at an OpenSCAD project, and thought it came out quite well!

This was designed to be printed on a Prusa MK3S (I used the Powder-Coated bed and PETG). If you have a smaller print bed, to maintain compatibility, just tweak the "board_line_count" and "board_width" parameters to make sure it fits the bed.

The frame (if you want to use it) should automatically adjust to fit the board, but you may want to adjust the frame tolerance depending on your printer.

I have left as many of the other parameters as customisable as I could, but if you tweak some of the other parameters, you may have to re-export all the letter STL files to make sure they fit.

I found printing in 100% infill just fine with a 0.15mm layer height, as there would have only been one layer of infill anyway.

Board was printed in Prusament Black PETG, and the Letters in Sunlu White PETG. I have added the frame as I thought some people might like it, but I have not used it.
